**Streaming Hub** is A stream-oriented framework to create scientific workflows through visual programming and flow-based programming.
It provides a web interface to create scientific workflows, connect to sensory data streams, pipe sensory data through workflows, and visualize analytics in real-time.
A repository of preset workflows is also being built to serve common use cases.
