Early diagnosis is crucial for proper treatment of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. Although progress has been made to accurately diagnose ASD, it is far from ideal. It often requires various tests like behavioral assessments, observations from caretakers over a period of time to correctly determine the existence of Autism. Even with this tedious testing often times individuals are misdiagnosed. However, there remains promise in the development of accurate detection using various modalities of Biomedical Images, EEG, and Eye movement.

So, for our research, we plan to investigate the relationship between Eye movements (oculomotor plant), EEG, and ASD using Machine Learning. We aim to identify unique patterns in oculomotor plant or EEG or the combination in the ASD population. These patterns will enable us to develop intelligent systems for accurate early diagnosis.
