Real-Time Advanced Eye Movements Analysis Pipeline (RAEMAP) is an advanced pipeline to analyze traditional positional gaze measurements as well as advanced eye gaze measurements. The proposed architecture of RAEMAP include real-time analysis of fixations, saccades, ambient/focal coefficient K, gaze transition entropy, index of pupillary activity (IPA), and Low/High index of pupillary activity (LHIPA). RAEMAP will also provide visualizations of fixations, fixations on AOIs, heatmaps, and dynamic AOI generation in real-time.
