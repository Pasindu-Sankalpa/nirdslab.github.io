**Human trafficking** is a global phenomenon referring to the illegal forced transportation of individuals between international or national borders to be exploited for labor or commercial sex. Our objective is to develop a systems dynamic model of human trafficker and victims interactions using social media and real victims/traffickers profiles (personas) with the help of big data analytics tools and methods. The developed systems dynamic models will help policy maker to devise both proactive and reactive interventions and policies against human trafficking activities through social media.
