Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 70 percent of Americans that can occur in people who have directly experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, serious accident, terrorist act, combat, rape, kidnapping, surgery, violent personal assault, or death.  Our objective is to develop a system that automates PTSD symptom assessment to help improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment monitoring.
